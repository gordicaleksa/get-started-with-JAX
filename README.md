## Get started with JAX! :computer: :zap:

The goal of this repo is to make it easier to get started with [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)!

`JAX` is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to `PyTorch` and `TensorFlow`. :sunglasses:

*Note: I'm only going to recommend content that I've personally analyzed and found useful here. 
If you want a comprehensive list check out the [awesome-jax repo](https://github.com/n2cholas/awesome-jax).*

## My Machine Learning with JAX Tutorials

*Tip on how to use notebooks: just open the notebook directly in Google Colab 
(you'll see a button on top of the Jupyter file which will direct you to Colab). 
This way you can avoid having to setup the Python env! (This was especially convenient for me since I'm on Windows which is still not supported)*
